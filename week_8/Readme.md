## Tuesday journal
I arrived at SAPHI early to find out that Liam was already here, so, I went in and said hi! He told me that when Cam comes in hes going to set me to do some tasks, I have feeling that it is goig to be the AI image recognition training data stuff again, although I am a little sad about it not being a exciting task I am happy that I can contribute to a real world project.
Turns out I am going to do some AI image recognition training data, this time I am doing people tho, seeing if they are sleeping, Have their seatbelts on, on their phone,a nd stuff like that. 
I also am going to spend the rest of the week with SAPHI as its exhibition week and I dont hvae to go to school, plus I dont want to be in the house to let me mum ease back into working slowly as she has been in hospital recently for stress related stuff.
I have completed the assigned task of marking 1200 images for AI data. I have also gotten cake for luncg, it was tasty. Now I am going to ask what else is there for me to do, I'm probably going to ask Cam, one of my LTI mentors.


## wednesday Journal
I started out the day by signing the papers making me officailly part of SAPHI, my title is junior software developer and I get payed around $30 an hour. but this can go up to 6 figures with in a few years.
I have worked on some more of the AI image recognition and doing a little side project involving AI and ChatGPT, essentially seeing if I can get an AI assistant that can create new commands and rewrite the main source code to better itself and allow me to grow and develop it into something I can use everyday to help me in all my computer related actvities. currently I am going through ChatGPT and giving it prompts to update a script like "make it so when new command files are written or the script is re-written any new packages that need to be imported are imported." However I am at the point where I can start testing it out and not needed to add anything new due to the fact that I can give a command like "Computer, write a new commmand to do [insert what u want to do with it]". Although I feeling that I should make it so it only works for my voice patterns and not anyone elses incase they want to do malicous things with it.
I have created a a AI image model and learnt some more things about how to train it, like i can use past training as a starting point and can constantly imporve upon it, it is very facinating especially since I am learning more about Ai and how it can help me in my day to day life.
