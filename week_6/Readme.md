# Todo for this week - Monday Journal
- finish glove project
- get a job with SAPHI

# LTI Journal - Wednesday Journal
##Morning Journal
I have arrived at SAPHI and two people are here, Eric, and somebody new. So guess I will have to wait until Cam is here because I believe I am having the meeting today about me working at SAPHI. I am so excited, This is like my dream job, so being able to have it this early is an amazing thing, now I know its just one day a week but being able to work in a place that I feel comfortable in, the co-workers are amazing people, and the atmosphere is just, just awesome. Plus I get to do what I love, OMG.

##Afternoon Journal
I had a short meeting about what next and Cam said he was going to send through the paper work for me to sign, a contract and a non-disclosure agreement. other then that the day wasn't very productive and I could've done more to make it so.

# Journal Task - Friday Journal
A bit ago I sent one of my mentors an email about if i should go to university and they replied this.
Hi Lucas, 

I think by far your best bet would be to do a degree in either Computer Science or Software Engineering.

Apprenticeships in software are few and far between. I think coming straight out of highschool it would be very difficult to find something decent. A lot of companies (especially in Newcastle) won't even hire developers straight out of Uni. They want people to have 2-3 years of prior experience in the industry as well.

My personal suggestion would be to complete a Computer Science degree. It's only 3 years, and the experience you gain over that time is quite wide ranging. There's courses involving programming, but there's a lot that don't and cover things like design and maths and computational theory etc. 

Some of what's in the degree you'd never use again in your life, but that's not really the point. Being able to learn and work with others on things that you might not be all that interested in is a challenge in itself. It's character building, and it's a reality of working life. So while the academic skills you learn are important, the other "soft skills" that you implicitly pick up by going through a tertiary degree are just as important. Most employers realise that getting a degree isn't a walk in the park, and requires social skills and good written word and things like that just as much as it requires intellectual skill. I think that's why they still rate degrees quite highly, and if you don't have that piece of paper, you're automatically at a significant disadvantage when it comes to getting a foot in the door and starting a career.

While I'm on the topic of starting a career - If you can, I think the best way to really stand out as an applicant is to find a job in the software development industry, working part time, when you get to the second half of your degree. In some cases it's even worth studying part time and working part time while you finish the degree, just to get that important industry experience in. It makes you a much more viable candidate for roles that you apply for once Uni is finished.

This is all just my opinion of course, but I have worked in a lot of different roles over the years with a lot of software developers. I'd say it's probably about 10-15% of them make it in a software development career without a degree. And of those, all the ones I've known took longer to get where they wanted to be than it would've taken if they had just gotten the degree in the first place.    

I hope this helps. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.


This helps me by allowing me to better understand the benefits on university.
