# Journal Task - Friday Journal - How I came back from hurting myself.
I hurt myself on Monday, sprained my ankle playing a game of volleyball that would haunt me for some days. Everyone was joining in, the game felt like it was going in slow motion, and you could tell by how the air was electrofied that the game was intense. But... there was one serve, it was coming at my friend Lachlen and I, I jumped for it and so did he. Our hands collided in the air propelling the ball to the other side. 

But that wasn't where it happened, my future changed on the way down. As gravity took a hold of us in the air, counter acting the force that we propelled our selves up at, Lachlen came down. It was all good for Lachlen, he came down first and landing without a hitch. Me on the other hand, I wasn't so lucky, I came down hurtling towards the ground, but in my way, in the way of my landing... Was Lachlen. My foot hit his then repelled off, but it was too late as gravity still took hold and pulled it down, giving me the motion of my ankle snapping and folding in on itself.

The pain was thriving, shooting out and colonilising my entire foot, then leg. However this wasn't my first rodeo, I dealt with pain like this before, I could take it, and so I did. There were many battles some I won, some I lost, however in the end I was able get up on my other foot and hobbled to the office, to one of the people that could help, Quinn. 

She new what to do, she surrended my butt to a chair, and allowed for a 'IcePack', some whitchery that some how made the pain ease, and allowed for me to win the battles against my enemy, the pain. However this was short found as soon she instructed me to travel to what I call home in sake of a medicine she called 'Rest.' So, as I went on my way, still fighting the battle agaisnt the pain.

I made it to what I call home however I was loosing the battles and soon the pain took over, The pain fortified in my ankle making sure to stay there as long as possible. If only I knew how to force the pain to surrender or even better to eradicate it all. 

Even now, I am still fighting the pain, I am winning but even now they are reluctant to surrender, so, I am going to eradicate them all until the pain are no more.
